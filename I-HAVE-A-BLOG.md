# I Have a Blog

Welcome. Here I plan on writing a few posts about the things I've learned in my young career as a software engineer. I've worked in several organizations, large and small, and everywhere I've been, there has been little consensus or agreement on what "good code" means or looks like. I entered the workforce with tons of thoughts on Dijkstra's algorithm (which I have almost never thought about since learning it), but essentially thought-free on code quality (which impacts my/my coworkers quality of life extremely directly every day). In the first few years of my career, sometimes I wrote good code, but it was mostly by accident.

Looking back now, there are a lot of simple lessons I've learned that I would like to publicize, both to get feedback from other experienced developers on whether their experience lines up with my own, and to have a resource that a younger version of myself might have benefitted from.

## Some Baseline Assumptions

If the things I say here will be valuable at all, they will be valuable within a specific context. This context is, uncoincidentally, the set of things that are true about my career right now. I am assuming that:

* You are working in a large codebase with a team of other engineers (e.g., 20 other people).
* Much of the code you are working with was written by other people.
* The code you write will be maintained by other people in addition to yourself.
* The code you write will be seen by end-users or customers who will give feedback and stumble into unexpected states.
* Your coworkers are competent and well-meaning. Everyone is trying to do the right thing, even if there is not consensus on what that thing always is.

## Enjoy

I hope the things I say here are helpful or interesting or amusing. More to come.
